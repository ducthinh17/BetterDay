# About BetterDay


Depression is considered a disease of the 4.0 era, and it is no longer a strange concept in today's modern society. It is becoming more and more common and is a psychological disease that does not cause physical pain but causes strong negative effects on the patient's mind. Depression has varying degrees of severity, from mild to severe, affecting a person's feelings, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Many current domestic and foreign studies focus on statistics on the number of people suffering from depression as well as symptoms, harms, and solutions for each level.

In Vietnam, depression is currently increasing significantly, especially among young people. According to a study by the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF), depression and anxiety are the most common problems, with a rate of 18.3% of adults in Da Nang city having the disease. More than half of the patients who go through the first treatment will also go through the second, which can cause patients to lose their jobs, interfere with personal relationships, abuse drugs, and worsen their health status. According to statistics from the Institute of Mental Health - Bach Mai Hospital, about 30% of the population in Vietnam has mental disorders, with depression accounting for 25%. Depression is also one of the reasons for the increase in the number of suicides in Vietnam, with an estimated tens of thousands of people committing suicide due to depression every year.

Depression is a global issue, with an estimated 3.8% of the population affected, including 5.0% in adults and 5.7% in adults over 60 years of age, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). About 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression, and it can cause affected people to function less effectively at work, school, and home. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide, with more than 700,000 people dying by suicide every year. Depression is believed to be caused by genetic factors, imbalances in neurotransmitters, poor nutrient intake and absorption, physical health problems, and stress. 

Research on depression mostly focuses on medical data to study the causes and solutions inside patients. However, there is still no research on external factors, such as environmental factors, that can cause depression.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
